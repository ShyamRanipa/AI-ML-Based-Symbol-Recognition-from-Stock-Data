This project uses machine learning techniques to identify trends and forecast stock values using past financial data from Tata Steel and TISCO. The main objective is to create a useful regression model that will help with stock performance analysis and forecasting.

Key Features:

📊 Financial Data Analysis: Used stock market data (open, high, low, close, volume, turnover) from Tata Steel and TISCO.

🔍 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the dataset, handled null values, and structured it for supervised learning tasks.

🤖 Model Implementation: Built a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model to predict stock values.

🎯 Performance: Achieved 88.5% accuracy using an 80/20 train-test split.

Tech Stack:
Python,
Scikit-learn,
Pandas,
Matplotlib(for visualization),
Jupyter Notebook
